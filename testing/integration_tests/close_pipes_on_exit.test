#
# Checks if a pipe is closed on a process exit.
#
# Busybox runs $(echo foo) in a forked process and the parent process read child's
# output through a pipe until read(2) return 0, i.e. EOF. Since the parent calls
# wait4(2) after the pipe is closed, on child's exit, its opened files must be
# closed to return EOF to the parent.
#
# This script is a regression test for: https://github.com/nuta/kerla/issues/54

result=$(echo hello from pipe)
echo $result | grep "hello from pipe"
